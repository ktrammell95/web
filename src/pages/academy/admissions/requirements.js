        <h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>

        <p>
          The suggested computer for students is an Apple MacBook Pro laptop
          less than two years old. Minimum requirements:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>8GB of RAM</li>
          <li>500GB HDD</li>
          <li>
            macOS High Sierra (10.13) or Windows 10, subject to approval (see
            below)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Why a Mac? All of our students being on the same platform enables us
          to move at a much quicker pace. Processes like setting up new tools
          experience reduced friction because the same workflows apply to
          everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, The open source and web development communities are
          invested in tools and libraries that work best with POSIX based
          operating systems like UNIX, Linux, and Appleâ€™s macOS (BSD Unix). In
          short, we believe using the macOS best prepares our students to work
          in the web development industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Students who choose to study .NET development with us may also find
          substantial benefit from using macOS. A PC laptops can be approved for
          class use on a case by case basis during the interview process.
        </p>

        <h3>Software Requirements</h3>

        <p>
          The tools and materials used in our program are open source and free.
          No additional software is required.
