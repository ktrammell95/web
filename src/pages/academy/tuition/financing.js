        <p>
          Loanable helps students get the financing they need for coding
          bootcamps (tuition, equipment costs, and/or living expenses) through
          low-interest friends and family loans. Students are also able to split
          their total financing need into small chunks (think $500) allowing
          several of their friends and family to contribute as a group. You can
          also decide to get a friends and family loan for a specific expense
          like a computer or the first month of living expenses. If the student
          is not able to get all the funding they need from friends and family,
          we have great lending partners that provide the additional capital
          that they need.
