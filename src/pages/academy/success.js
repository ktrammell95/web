          While searching for opportunities to expand on his background in
          graphic design & photography, Julius, explored the idea of learning to
          code. It seemed like the perfect complement to his existing technology
          toolbox; an in demand skill; and a challenge that would prove to be
          both formidable and mentally stimulating.
          <br />
          <br />
          After a month of researching information on various bootcamps and
          completing a few coding tutorials online, he interviewed, was
          accepted, quit his full-time job, moved closer to St. Pete, worked
          tirelessly, and became a graduate of Cohort 8, affectionately dubbed
          “The Ocho” by a fellow classmate.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite the risks and challenges, Julius, now works for a premier, web
          design services company in Tampa. Having accomplished the personal
          goals he set for himself one year ago, he looks forward to the
          continued growth and development of his coding skills and to one day
          be combined with his love of golf.

          From youth development to software development...
          <br />
          <br />
          Meet Venel, a Juvenile Supervision Counselor studying human
          development turned Software Developer. Venel spent countless hours
          attempting to figure out ways to maximize his gaming experience to
          level the playing field against the youth he was supervising. While
          doing so, he found himself falling in love with everything he was
          learning about software so much that he decided to switch careers.
          <br />
          <br />
          After graduating and several months of dedicated job hunting, he
          landed his first tech job at a local startup, Net Synergy Virtual
          Solutions, where he was able to gain knowledge, experience, and
          additional skills in data aggregation. In an effort to grow and expand
          his skillset even more, Venel recently took on an exciting new role as
          an Engineer at Salesforce.

        >
          After years of being a customer service and marketing guru, Crystal
          found herself to be a textbook example of someone that needed a life
          and career pivot. While she had taken an interest in coding, she made
          every excuse in the book to not invest in it professionally.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thankfully, the SDG team and her stellar support system echoed every
          day: “You can’t afford NOT to invest in yourself, and you’re going to
          be great!” Crystal never looked back. The hours were studious and the
          caffeine ran rampant, but it’s one of the decisions she’s most proud
          of making.
          <br />
          <br />
          After embracing the opportunity to work for a killer start-up company,
          she moved onto Raymond James Financial where she is an Associate
          Interactive Specialist. When she’s not dabbling in a CMS for Financial
          Advisors, you can catch her assisting with SDG Jr's kids coding
          classes and geeking out at development conferences.

          <br />
          As a student in the final cohort of The Iron Yard in Tampa Bay, Taylor
          became ingrained in the community through the staff/'s encouragement
          to participate in local hackathons, meetups, and conferences. <br />
          <br />
          Now, she serves as a co-organizer for SDG Jr. to promote the
          importance of learning technology and problem solving skills to a
          younger generation. Taylor is a coordinator and in for the SDG Jr's

          I knew it would be hard, especially with three young children to care
          for. I also knew it would be worth it in the end. The Iron Yard
          experience turned out to be just as hard as I ever imagined, but also
          just as worth it. I accomplished what I set out to do. And really,
          there are few things better in life than that. Achieving a goal you've
