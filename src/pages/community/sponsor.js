            In today’s development industry, diversity is the greatest issues
            faced by employers to date. Currently, the percentage of women
            coders in the field is less than 20% while African Americans and
            Hispanic or Latino populations represent less than 3% of the overall
            coding community.
          </p>
          <p>
            For these reasons and more, we’ve created the Diversity Scholarship.
            Scholarships are offered on a need-based system, covering from
            $1,900 to $14,900 of tuition for recipients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Women, U.S. military veterans, and populations underrepresented in
            technology are eligible to apply. Scholarships are awarded based on
            financial need and the applicant's ability to meet the requirements
            of both the course and scholarship application.
