          Suncoast Developers Guild believes strongly that programming must be
          accessible at all ages, and our kids classes are one way we inch
          toward making that belief a reality. Suncoast Deverlopers Guild Jr
          provides free coding classes to children ages 8-16 in the Tampa Bay
          area. We strive to make learning fun and teach our students new
          skills. We currently offer three classes, but we are working to
          provide more programs.

        <h3>Scratch</h3>
        <p>
          {ScratchLink} is a visual program language provided by Lifelong
          Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. We like to use Scratch to
          break down many barriers that prevent students from learning to code,
          while still teaching the basics and logic behind programming. Parents:
          you might want some ear plugs after we teach them how to program
          sounds.

        <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
        <p>
          HTML and CSS are the building blocks of web development--every website
          has HTML and CSS in it! In this class, we teach the basics of web
          programming and CSS animations, allowing the students plenty of time
          to experiment and personalize their pages.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="class">
        <h3>Javascript</h3>
        <p>
          Javascript is a powerful programming language that is used in every
          web browser. We utilize fun activities and animations to teach kids
          about functions, strings, arrays and more. We offer both introductory
          and intermediate javascript classes. Come prepared to look for every
          last quote, period and semi-colon!

        <h3>Class Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Suncoast Deverlopers Guild Jr offers single and multi night classes
          throughout the year. Students are required to bring their own
          computer. Both Mac and PCs are welcome, as long as it is in working
          shape and fully charged. All software used is free online--no
          downloading required! We recommend using Chrome or Firefox in our
          classes, and we cannot guarantee that other web browsers will work.
        </p>

          Imagination and love for computers are the only requirements for our
          classes. Basic typing skills are helpful, but we will go at a slow
          enough pace for students that are not as familiar with typing. Our
          introductory classes are for beginners with no prerequisites and we
          recommend attending our intro class before any of our intermediate
          classes.

          Our goal is for students to have a great time learning and playing
          with new tools and ideas. There are no tests, grades or homework. That
          said, we do expect students to be engaged in every class. We also
          require a parent or a guardian to remain with the student for the
          entirety of the course for students under the age of 16.
        </p>

          Most classes are hosted on our St. Pete campus. Our Tampa classes are
          hosted at local companies who volunteer their location. If your
          company is interested in hosting one of our classes please {KidsEmail}
          .
