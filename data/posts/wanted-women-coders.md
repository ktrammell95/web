  Women in tech is a movement that isn't as widely discussed as others, but it's
  still a huge deal. From Grace Hopper to Dorothy Vaughan, it's evident that the
  computer science industry was dominated by women up until very recently.
  Denise Roane provides insight on what drove this change.

In the past few years, many sizable women’s movements such as the #metoo, equal pay, gender neutrality, and gender acceptance have taken center stage. They have been bringing to light some of the struggles women have faced for years. Within these large movements lie many minor movements that, though not as heavily discussed, are just as important as those that are. One of these minor movements has been the push to get women to, once again, engage in jobs in computer science; a field they once dominated.

From Ada Lovelace, who is known as the first computer programmer, to Grace Hopper and Dorothy Vaughan; female domination in the world of computer science, coding, and programming was nothing new and, in fact, it was encouraged... Until the mid 1980s when the personal computer gained popularity. It has only been over the past few decades that the myth "men are better computer programmers than women" became instilled in our psyche. Even though, historically, it was women who created the languages that enabled computers to “speak” and “think”. For example, let's look at the accomplishments of Grace Hopper and Dorothy Vaughan. 

Grace Hopper, was a rear admiral in the United States Navy as well as a mathematician and a computer programmer. It was her work using words, rather than numbers, that led to the creation of COBOL and much of the computer language we still use today. Dorothy Vaughan was hired as a computing unit supervisor and mathematician who worked for NASA. She became the foremost FORTRAN programming expert in the world. During her stint with NASA, she took part in creating many of the computing systems they used to monitor satellite and shuttle until she retired in 1971. 

During the mid-1980’s, as stated before, the larger industrial computers being used at the time were shelved to make way for a much smaller, more powerful machine; the personal computer. In seemingly an instant, the idea of the girl techie became not only nonexistent, but something that was scoffed at and discouraged. In result, it became the norm for both men and women to believe that coding and tech was just something (like math) that boys do better than girls.

The reason for this was chalked up to a boy’s propensity to tinker with the internal components of the machine- not something girls where known to be interested in. This not only gave them a better concept of the inner mechanical workings of the gadget, but also gave them the ability to diagnose and repair the apparatus. Consequently, this skill instantly began making them the “go-to” candidate for technological advice thereby creating the illusion that men were better suited for the task. To make matters more complex, when the tech industry became “THE” popular subject in the movie making arena all of the computer experts (including the nerds and geeks) were depicted by men. In fact, it wasn’t until 1995 that a woman appeared in a movie as a computer programmer. That movie was titled _The Net _and starred Sandra Bullock.
