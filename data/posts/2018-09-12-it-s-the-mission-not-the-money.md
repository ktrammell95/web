When our team first decided to launch our school in Tampa Bay, it was absolutely paramount, to me at least, that we operate it as a not-for-profit.



I believe, in for-profit education at least, there is an inherent conflict of interest between the school and the student. The school collects revenue whether or not the student actually learns anything, let alone is able to graduate with employable skills. I'm not convinced this necessarily always leads to an ethical dilemma, but it's something that every school needs to be accountable for. In this sense, for-profit schools have a problem of trust, where public and non-profits have problem of scale.

In the developer community, there is often a distinct impression that code “bootcamps” are predatory actors that take advantage of eager-to-learn students and pump out graduates who couldn't code their way out of a paper bag. I won't pretend that schools like that don't exist. Changing that perception will take effort, but I think the transparency of our business model, and the open source nature of our curriculum, go a long way towards that goal.



Also, computer programming is very specialized work; it can be hard for seasoned engineers to grok how it's possible someone can learn to do what they do in a just few a months. I think this is a matter of perspective. We aren't training people develop novel algorithms or solve academic computer science problems. We're teaching them the practical skills they need build web sites, and contribute to a team solving business problems. Our track record with alumni proves that these graduates are valuable assets to our hiring partners as junior developers.



Succeeding at operating an immersive code school is tough work. Sustaining the business model would be especially challenging if we had stakeholders looking for returns on their investment. We never want to be in a situation where the interests of our students can be bought and sold.



The most important piece to our school succeeding will be how we align with employers and the community. I think our team has already proven that what we do is working in Tampa Bay. As we continue to deepen those roots, I am proud to say The Academy at Suncoast Developers Guild is a code school that serves people, not profits.
